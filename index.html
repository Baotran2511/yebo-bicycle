                <h2>A NEW GENERATION OF THE VINTAGE BIKE</h2>
                <p>That photograph made me remember my old teacher who taught us high school. She is slim with along hair and blue eyes. Do you remember her? Our enghlish teacher, her name is Sara. I can’t forget that days when she played game with us in each class and we sang ‘ Anilmal song’ together. I also remember that She was very sad when our class didn’t do homework and we felt so guilty with her. Then we studied Enghlish hard to fix our mistakes and she was so happy.</p>
